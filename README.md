## What this is
This repository contains the source for a documentation/help center website that includes searchable docs, filters, language selection, and useful resources sections (Knowledge Base, Community, Support, etc.). It's designed to be easy to run locally and to deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static hosting provider.

## Features
- Searchable documentation with filters
- Multi-language support (UI/labels ready)
- Sections for Products, SDKs, APIs, and Useful Resources
- Responsive layout and accessible HTML/CSS
- Easy local development and deployment
- No proprietary/trademarked content included

## Tech stack (suggested)
You can implement this using any static site generator or framework. Typical choices:
- Docusaurus (recommended for documentation sites)
- Hugo / Jekyll / MkDocs
- Plain HTML/CSS/JS (vanilla or with a frontend framework)
